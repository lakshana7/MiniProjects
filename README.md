- Win, lose, or tie outcome displayed after each round

**Technologies Used:** Python (Random module for computer choice)

### 2. Scientific Calculator
A Python-based calculator that performs a variety of mathematical operations such as:
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Advanced functions (square root, power, trigonometry)

Features:
- Interactive user input
- Handles a range of mathematical functions

**Technologies Used:** Python (Math library for advanced functions)

### 3. Snake Game
A classic Snake Game implemented using Python. The objective is to guide the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding the walls and its own tail.

Features:
- Player-controlled snake movement
- Random food generation
- Score tracking system
